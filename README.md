# DoguGpt inspired from the tutorial of Andrej Karpathy
The Chatbot part is not finished as I do not know how to align the gpt. I am working on it. The decoder part is right now finished.
Personal chatbot with the given data from whatsapp chats. I will be using transformer architecture.
## Dependencies:
All you need is Pytorch running on the gpu. Also you can always give your chat from whatsapp that it would train on your conversations.
