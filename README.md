# DoguGpt inspired from the tutorial of Andrej Karpathy
The Chatbot part is not finished. I am working on it. The decoder part is right now finished.
Personal chatbot with the given data from whatsapp chats. I used the initial transformer architecture from the google paper. 

## Dependencies:
All you need is Pytorch running on the gpu. Also you can always give your chat from whatsapp that it would train on your conversations. You need a GPU, if you do not have one I do not recommend running the model on the CPU.
