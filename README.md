# DoguGpt inspired from the tutorial of Andrej Karpathy
The Chatbot part is not finished as I do not know how to align the gpt. I am working on it. The decoder part is right now finished.
Personal chatbot with the given data from whatsapp chats. I will be using transformer architecture. The Jupyter notebook file is not complete. The jupyter Notebook file can be seen as an introduction, tests and ideas of I have before I start implementing. The finished code can be found at the normal Python file Gpt.py . 
## Dependencies:
All you need is Pytorch running on the gpu. Also you can always give your chat from whatsapp that it would train on your conversations. You need a GPU, if you do not have one I do not recommend running the model on the CPU.
